# PH390R_Final_Project

Exploratory Data Analysis final project for PH390R course at Umass Amherst. In this project, I explore crimes data found on the FBI website (plus a couple supplimetary datasets) to find out what people are most likely to get arrested for. This analysis this then further broken up into arrest by sex and arrest by race. 

Code was written in R using libraries such as `tidyverse`.
